This repository contains various tasks completed during my web development internship at osais infobyte. 

Hello Everyone!!!
I am Rushikesh Bhagat.
Well, I am a web developer enthusiast...
This blog will document my experience as a web development intern at Oasis Infobyte (held in February 2023).
I would like to thank Oasis Infobyte for giving me this opportunity to enhance my skills and work on such amazing projects.
I completed all three tasks during this Web Development Internship
  1) LEVEL-02 : Task-01 : Calculator
  2) LEVEL-02 : Task-02 : Tribute Page
  3) LEVEL-02 : Task-03 : A Basic To-Do Webapp
  
  
The entire job experience was incredible. I've learned new things, and doing so has greatly aided my exploration of new things.
It was a pleasure to serve as an intern web coder at Oasis Infobyte.
