Hello Everyone!
My name is Rushikesh Bhagat, and I recently completed a web development internship at Oasis Infobyte. During my one-month internship, I had the privilege to work on three exciting tasks that helped me improve my web development skills and gain valuable experience working in a professional environment.

##Task 1: Creating a Responsive Calculator
The first task was to create a responsive calculator website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used my HTML and CSS skills to build the basic structure and design of the site. To add functionality, I incorporated JavaScript, which helped me to create a dynamic and interactive calculator. This task provided an excellent introduction to web development and helped me to refine my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

##Task 2: Creating a Tribute Page
The second task was to create a tribute page using HTML and CSS. Being an avid cricket fan, I decided to pay tribute to one of my all-time favourite cricketers, MS Dhoni. I began by creating the basic layout of the page using HTML, which included a header, main content area, and a footer. I then used custom CSS styling and relevant images to make the page visually appealing.

##Task 3: Creating a To-Do Web App
The third and final task was to create a to-do web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I started by creating the HTML structure of the app, including a form to add tasks and a list to display them. Using my CSS skills, I designed the app to be visually appealing and user-friendly. To add functionality, I incorporated JavaScript, which helped me to create an interactive and dynamic app. The app allowed users to add, edit, and delete tasks with ease, making it a useful tool for managing daily tasks.

Overall, my web development internship experience at Oasis Infobyte was fantastic. I am grateful to the company for giving me this opportunity and helping me to develop my skills as a web developer. I am excited to use the skills I learned during my internship in my future endeavours, and I am confident that my experience at Oasis Infobyte will serve me well as I continue to grow in my career.
